# Algorithms assigments

This repository has all assignments done in the course Algorithmic at the University of Granada. __All assignments have been written in Spanish__.
Some source files may also be found in those assignments where there were required. 

A total of 4 assigments were given in this course, divided into the following topics or algorithmic design:

1. The __first__ assignment was about efficiency analysis, comparing algorithms with different efficiency order in different PCs.
2. The __second__ assignment was about Divide and Conquer algorithms, comparing its efficiency with respect to trivial algorithms.
3. The __third__ assignment was about Greedy algorithms, analyzing its efficiency with respect to trivial algorithms and justifying the optimality where it was required.
4. The __fourth__ assignment was about Dynamic Programming, analyzimg its efficiency with respect to trivial algorithms and justifying both optimality and applicability of this type of algoritm in specified problem.
